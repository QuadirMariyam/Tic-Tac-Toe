# Tic-Tac-Toe

A JavaScript SaaS based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey. Special thanks to Apna College for their free lectures and MDN for their extensive documentation. This game showcases basic game logic and dynamic updates.

  The objective is to develop a stylish, responsive and functional Tic Tac Toe game between two Users as opponent players, updating the scores respectively.
